## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
​
Users who need to treck time for dofferent purposes:

* Users, who ned timer for personal aims - in sport, at home, for board games ect
* Users who need time trecker for working purposes - freelansers, full-time workers, who want to track task completion time for improve personal efficiency
​
### **User Stories:**

* As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
* As a user, I want to navigate the page and buttons to find what I require quickly and easily.
* As user, I want to see dysplaying results of my time trecking 
​
### **Site Aims:**

* To provide users simple and usefuul time tracking tool
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
For the page I decided dark-gray rgb(30 31 31 / 86%) color in office theme for contrast with background. Green bottom for start, pause - yellow, red - reset and light-gray for round, because they typically associated with these activities. For background I chose light rose rgb(255, 231, 226) and blue rgb(55, 133, 247) theme with gradient, because it unobtrusive theme, which not distract from time trecker.
​
### **Typography**

Throughout the page, there are three font used font-family Zaychik.
​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**
​
#### *Navigation:*

* Buttons are presented in a way that is always obvious and reable
* on smaller screens there is menu is provided to ensure mobile users have an optimal experience
​
#### *features
​
* This is where you will place all of your features think about each section of the page include a screenshot and a few bullet points on how it's presented and why
​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
A webpage is a living beast it's going to evolve past the initial stages of release generally, it's always good to discuss where you this the page may go in the future
​
* At the time of making this page i didn't have the understanding to actual send e-mails from the contact form so intergration with email.js to send e-mails would improve the users experience
​
* Due to the subject matter, we have discussed the idea of including a small JS game to engage the user
​
## **Testing Phase**
​
This is the hardest bit of the readme, when we have completed a page we need to discuss testing.
​
Here is a good idea to talk about how and why you have tested with certain tools and validators so here a list of things to talk through
​
* Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
​
* Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
​
* Validators - Here include images from w3c html validator and css jigsaw (jshint for js and pep8 for python) and the results that came from it
​
​
## **Bugs**
​
We always have bugs in development, a few bullet points here to talk about bugs you found and how you fixed them, in later projects this will be more detailed
​
* Issue - When on mobile the user had horizontal scroll with items overflowing
* Cause - The images had absolute positioning and caused them to go off screen
* Resolution - Changed the width of the image to stay within the confines of the screen.
